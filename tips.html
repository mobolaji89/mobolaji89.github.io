	  <h3>How to cast your spinning rod</h3>
	  <ol>
	    <li>
		Tie on your lure, or hook with bait attached (preferably worms).
		</li>
		<li>
		Hold the rod with your hand (dominant). Make sure the reel is below the rod. I usually put the reel foot between my index and middle finger, but some others may prefer between middle and ring instead.
		</li>
		<li>
		Open the bail of the spinning real with your other hand to release at least about a foot of line, and then close the bail once you have a comfortable length.
		</li>
		<li>
		Hold part the line close to the foot of the spinning real with your index finger.
		</li>
		<li>
		Open the bail again with your other hand.
		</li>
		<li>
		Now, while pointing the rod at your target... In one smooth motion bring the rod vertically above the shoulder of your dominant hand (it can be slightly behind your back also), and push the rod forward, while letting go of your index finger to release the line.
		</li>
		<li>
		Close the bail with your free hand, and begin to reel in the line.
		</li>
